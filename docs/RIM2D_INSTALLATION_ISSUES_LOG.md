# RIM2D Installation Issues and Troubleshooting Log

## System Information
- **OS**: Linux 6.12.43+deb12-amd64 (Debian)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 Laptop GPU (8GB VRAM)
- **CUDA Version**: 13.0
- **Driver Version**: 580.82.07

## Overview
This document details all issues encountered during the RIM2D installation process following the Quick Start Guide, including resolutions and workarounds applied.

---

## 1. Initial System Check

### ✅ GPU Verification - SUCCESS
```bash
# GPU NetCDF compatibility test
nvfortran -O2 -cuda -gpu=ccall -Minfo gpu_netcdf_capi_check.f90 \
    $(nc-config --cflags) $(nc-config --libs) \
    -Wl,-rpath,"$CONDA_PREFIX/lib" \
    -o gpu_netcdf_capi_check

./gpu_netcdf_capi_check
# Output: CUDA device 0:NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 Laptop GPU
#         CUDA kernel OK. y(1)=    4.000000
#         NetCDF C-API write OK: gpu_netcdf_check.nc (value=    4.000000     )
```

**Result**: GPU and basic NetCDF functionality confirmed working.

## 2. Missing Dependencies Issues

### Issue 2.1: CMake Not Installed
**Error encountered when running `bash install-RIM2D`:**
```
install-RIM2D: line 43: cmake: command not found
```

**Root Cause**: CMake was not installed on the system.

**Resolution**:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y cmake
```

**Verification**:
```bash
cmake --version
# Output: cmake version 3.25.1
```

### Issue 2.2: Doxygen Not Available
**Warning during NetCDF Fortran configuration:**
```
configure: WARNING: Doxygen not found - documentation will not be built
```

**Root Cause**: Doxygen package missing for documentation generation.

**Resolution**: User installed doxygen with sudo privileges.

**Verification**:
```bash
which doxygen
# Output: /usr/bin/doxygen
```

## 3. NetCDF Fortran Compilation Issues

### Issue 3.1: Module System Integration Problems
**Error**: The `install-RIM2D` script failed due to module system commands not being available:
```
install-RIM2D: line 21: module: command not found
install-RIM2D: line 25: module: command not found
install-RIM2D: line 28: module: command not found
install-RIM2D: line 30: /cluster/spack/testing/nvhpc: No such file or directory
```

**Root Cause**: The installation script was designed for HPC cluster environments with module systems, not standalone installations.

**Resolution**: Bypassed module commands and configured environment manually.

### Issue 3.2: Compiler Compatibility Problems
**Error during NetCDF Fortran configure:**
```
configure: error: in `/home/roller/Desktop/rim2d/netcdf-fortran':
configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.
If you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.
```

**Root Cause**: Mixed compiler toolchain issues between NVIDIA HPC SDK compilers (nvc) and system libraries.

**Resolution**: Used mixed compiler approach:
```bash
export FC=nvfortran    # NVIDIA Fortran compiler for GPU support
export F77=nvfortran
export CC=gcc          # GNU C compiler for compatibility
export CXX=g++         # GNU C++ compiler for compatibility
```

### Issue 3.3: Position Independent Code (PIC) Compilation Errors
**Error during NetCDF Fortran compilation:**
```
/usr/bin/ld: .libs/nf_attio.o: relocation R_X86_64_32S against `.bss' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/usr/bin/ld: failed to set dynamic section sizes: bad value
```

**Root Cause**: NVIDIA Fortran compiler required explicit PIC flags for shared library compilation.

**Resolution**: Added PIC flags to compiler options:
```bash
export FCFLAGS="-fPIC -g"
export FFLAGS="-fPIC -g"
```

### Issue 3.4: Module File Incompatibility
**Error during RIM2D compilation:**
```
NVFORTRAN-F-0004-Corrupt or Old Module file /home/roller/micromamba/envs/zarrv3/include/netcdf.mod
NVFORTRAN/x86-64 Linux 25.7-0: compilation aborted
```

**Root Cause**: NetCDF module files compiled with gfortran were incompatible with nvfortran.

**Resolution**:
1. Removed conflicting module files: `rm -f /home/roller/micromamba/envs/zarrv3/include/*.mod`
2. Compiled NetCDF Fortran specifically with nvfortran
3. Installed new module files to local directory

---

## 4. Library Linking Issues

### Issue 4.1: NetCDF Library Version Mismatch
**Error during RIM2D linking:**
```
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libnetcdf.so.22, needed by /home/roller/Desktop/rim2d/lib/libnetcdff.so, not found
/usr/bin/ld: /home/roller/Desktop/rim2d/lib/libnetcdff.so: undefined reference to `nc_inq_unlimdim'
/usr/bin/ld: /home/roller/Desktop/rim2d/lib/libnetcdff.so: undefined reference to `nc_def_var_fill'
[... hundreds more undefined references ...]
```

**Root Cause**:
- NetCDF Fortran library compiled against different NetCDF C library version
- Library path conflicts between locally built and system NetCDF libraries
- RPATH not properly set for shared library dependencies

**Attempted Resolutions**:
1. **Mixed library paths**: Used system NetCDF C with local NetCDF Fortran
2. **LD_LIBRARY_PATH adjustment**: Added system library paths
3. **Manual linking**: Attempted direct nvfortran compilation with explicit library flags

**Current Status**: Linking issues remain unresolved due to ABI compatibility between different NetCDF versions.

---

## 5. Source Code Issues

### Issue 5.1: Fortran Source Syntax Errors
**Error during manual compilation:**
```
NVFORTRAN-S-0026-Unmatched quote (source/readin.f: 75)
NVFORTRAN-S-0026-Unmatched quote (source/readin.f: 91)
NVFORTRAN-S-0023-Syntax error - unbalanced parentheses (source/writegrid.f: 43)
```

**Root Cause**: Source code may have character encoding issues or compiler-specific syntax requirements.

**Current Status**: Individual source files have compilation issues that prevent manual build approach.

---

## 6. Environment Configuration Summary

### Successfully Configured Variables
```bash
# NetCDF paths
export NETCDF_LIB="-L/home/roller/Desktop/rim2d/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf"
export NETCDF_INCLUDE="-I/home/roller/Desktop/rim2d/include"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/roller/Desktop/rim2d/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

# Compiler selection
export FC=nvfortran
export F77=nvfortran
export CC=nvc          # Later changed to gcc for compatibility
export CXX=nvc++       # Later changed to g++ for compatibility
```

### Working Components Verified
1. ✅ **GPU functionality**: CUDA kernels execute correctly
2. ✅ **NetCDF basic operations**: File I/O working
3. ✅ **Compiler toolchain**: nvfortran available and functional
4. ✅ **Dependencies**: HDF5, zlib, and supporting libraries installed
5. ✅ **NetCDF Fortran modules**: Successfully compiled and installed

---

## 7. Lessons Learned and Recommendations

### Key Issues Summary
1. **Dependency Management**: Standard package managers may not provide GPU-compatible versions
2. **Compiler Ecosystem**: Mixing NVIDIA HPC SDK with system libraries requires careful configuration
3. **Library Versioning**: NetCDF library ecosystem has complex interdependencies
4. **Module Systems**: HPC-oriented software often assumes cluster environments

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Complete NetCDF rebuild**: Compile entire NetCDF stack (C + Fortran) with consistent toolchain
2. **Container approach**: Consider using pre-built containers with matching library versions
3. **Source code review**: Investigate and fix Fortran source syntax issues
4. **Alternative compilation**: Try CMake with explicit library specifications

### Working Test Case
The `gpu_netcdf_capi_check` test demonstrates that the fundamental components (GPU, CUDA, NetCDF) are functional, indicating the system is capable of running RIM2D once linking issues are resolved.
