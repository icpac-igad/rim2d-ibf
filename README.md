### To get the source code of RIM2D model

RIM2D is a 2D hydraulic inundation model specifically designed for fluvial and pluvial flood simulation. 
RIM2D has simplified approaches implemented for simulating sewer system, roof drainage and infiltration. 
Thus it is well suited for fast urban inundation simulation. RIM2D is coded in Fortran90 and runs the simulations on GPUs. 
Compiling thus requires a NVIDIA CUDA enabled Fortran compiler.
